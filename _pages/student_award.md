### Mrs. Krishna Devi Sanadhya Memorial Award:
----

I proposed an award in honor of my late mother Mrs. Krishna Devi Sanadhya, and I thank the senate of IIT Jodhpur, headed by [Prof. Santanu Chaudhury](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~santanuc/) during his tenure as Director from 2019 to 2024, for approving the proposal in 2023. 

This award honors one student every year from the graduating batch at IIT Jodhpur. The award is given to the girl student from B.Tech. (CSE) with the best academic performance. A Gold medal and a Cash award is given to the awardee from 2024. In the first year (2023), the award carried a Silver medal and a cash award.

The following students have been the recipients of the award since its inception.


Year 2025: Niharika Dadu (B21CS052)

Year 2024: [Harshita Kalani (B20CS019)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iitjodhpur_iitjodhpur-convocation2024-topgraduates-activity-7256270477441019904-S9yA/)
