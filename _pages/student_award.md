### Mrs. Krishna Devi Sanadhya Memorial Award:
----

I proposed an award in honor of my late mother Mrs. Krishna Devi Sanadhya, and I thank the senate of IIT Jodhpur to accept the proposal for the same in 2023. This award honors one student every year from the graduating batch. The award is given to the girl student from B.Tech. (CSE) with the best academic performance. A Gold medal and a Cash award is given to the awardee. In the first year (2023), the award carried a Silver medal but from 2024 onwards, it carries a Gold medal.

The following students have been the recipients of the award since its inception.
