I used to play online chess till few years ago, but no longer active now. However, I try to follow all tournaments that Vishy plays in. Sites I like to follow live chess games are chessbase.in, chess24.com and chess.com

### Meeting with Vishy

I could meet and play a simultaneous exhibition game against GM Viswanathan Anand at a function organized at NIIT University in Neemrana in 2012. I resigned on move 23 when Vishy was threatening to queen his pawn (in fact, my position was already hopeless from a few moves earlier). Here are two pictures from that occasion:
